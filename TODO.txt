Creature class methods should be able delta_distance and not delta_time.
This is because speed should work very differently for Player than for Prey, the two subclasses of Creature.
Also, adjust the names of creature methods so that methods that do a single "step" of motion start with
the word "step". These would be the sort of methods that often get called inside of a _process

Create two methods for Creature:
  set_path
    takes a path (a poolvector or whatever, list of pts) and records the path as a member var of the Creature
  step_path
    move along the path by a given distance, and update the current path with the progress (so it consis
    only of whatever remains)

Create a test tileset with a navmesh built in and try to get pathfinding to work
