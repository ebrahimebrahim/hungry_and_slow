obstacle avoid areas should be a bit larger than collision areas for trees
this is how I was previously preventing prey slamming into or rubbing up on trees
how to implement this now that trees are just tiles?
maybe instead of trees being, tiles, make tiles mark areas where trees will grow

hunger/speed relationship, and a UI displaying the hunger bar

food for prey
