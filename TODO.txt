further clean up the raytracing-based pathfinding of Preys:
- Make current_speed be a creature variable that should be always set and used for movement
- Make raycast distances be consts instead of magic numbers
- After steering is completed there should a recover period before we go back to more steering or running away. The recovery period can be half raycast_dist/current_speed.
